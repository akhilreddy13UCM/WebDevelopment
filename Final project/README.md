There is a receipt column to the left, and in the middle, we will have items available in the gas station, a number keypad to the right, and there are six gas pumps at the bottom.

Firstly, when the customer asks something the items that are in the gas station will be available in the middle column, we will also have a search button to easily find required items from the list of items.

We will also have some common items like coffee, fountain, pizza, and banana at the top for easy access.we can click them.

Now when we select the item, then the item will be added to the receipt column at left , and the basket count is increased by one, and the selected item price is also added to the total price.

If an item needs to be deleted from the basket then in the receipt column(left-most), item name only needs to be double-clicked(not item-price) so the item will be deleted from the basket.

When the customer asks for gas then the person at the billing counter will click authorize then a dialog box is displayed that asks the number of dollars of gas required. Filling the pump takes 10 seconds of time until then the border of the authorization button will be blinked in two-different colors.Gas cannot be deleted as gas is filled in the vehicle.

At last, we need to enter the amount that is given by the customer, After clicking the “=” (equal to) button the change amount that needs to be given to the customer will be displayed below the number keypad along with a completed symbol in the green color that states as a transaction completed. After completing the transaction if we click any new item,then no new item is added in to basket as transaction is already completed, just basket count and total price is displayed.

The button named “new” in the keypad is clicked for a new transaction, the “AC” button is clear all numbers in calculator, “D” button is to backspace i.e delete last entered digit.
